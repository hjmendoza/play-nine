# Play Nine

This is a simple React math game.

**Objective**: Given a random number of stars, use a range of numbers from 1-9 to sum up to the total number of stars. Use up every number, without repeating, before you run out of attempts!

**How to Play**: 
  * Click on green numbers to sum up to total stars displayed.
  * Click the check button to verify your answer.
    * If correct, a double check mark will appear. Click to submit your final answer!
    * If incorrect, an X will appear. Select a different set of numbers and try again!
  * You can only use each number once.
  * You may 'redraw', request a different random number of stars, up to 5 times.
