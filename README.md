# Play Nine

This is a simple React math game.

**Objective**: Given a random number of stars, use a range of numbers from 1-9 to sum up to the total number of stars. Use up every number, without repeating, before you run out of attempts!

**Rules**: 
  * You can only use each number once.
  * You may 'redraw', request a different random number of stars, up to 5 times.


**Getting Started**
  * Clone this repo
  * Within the project's directory in terminal, open the app using `npm start`
  * The game will open up in your browser. Have fun! 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Inspired by Samer Buna's *React.js: Getting Started* Pluralsight course.
